UPDATE hyperav_products SET prDescr_Long = "Compact in size but with Full HD, missing nothing in detail, the LG 22MT45 is the perfect personal TV.
     
Full 1080p High Definition
The LG 22MT45 features 1080p Full HD resolution. This gives more detail than standard resolution when using HD sources such as a Blu-ray player or HD TV channel for immersive viewing. It's also got a high contrast ratio of 5,000,000:1, making blacks deeper, colours more vivid and giving a greater depth of image.
     
Fully connected
For connecting to digital sources the 22MT45 has an HDMI socket, while for analogue sources there are SCART and component connections. The USB socket is useful for plugging in digital media devices and playing back music and pictures. It also has a PC input, making it ideal as a dual-purpose TV/monitor.
     
Sound's OK
The sound quality of the LG 22MT45 is better than its peers; Virtual Surround gives a spacious sound and is adjustable to suit your personal preferences. Alternatively, add a soundbar from our broad range to give the audio a massive boost.
     
Slim and attractive
Featuring a black finish and slim bezel, the 22MT45 is stylish and unobtrusive, while the rounded gloss black, pedestal stand is tilt adjustable. For wall mounting, the set takes a standard VESA fitting.
     
For a compact TV that doesn't compromise on resolution, the LG 22MT45 offers superb value."
