SET prDescr_Long = "<p>With a built-in DVD player, USB, twin HDMIs plus more, this famous German branded TV packs in a lot for a very modest price</p>

<p><b>LED backlight</b></p>
<p>Featuring LED backlighting, the Blaupunkt 23/157 creates a vivid picture with high contrast, giving enhanced colours and deep blacks. A wide viewing angle means you don't have to be square on, making it the perfect set for kitchens and those rooms where your viewing position changes.</p>

<p>The HD screen is just the thing for viewing Sky HD, Virgin HD or Freeview HD channels. Connect your TV set-top box via HDMI and you'll enjoy 720p HD-Ready TV with breath-taking clarity and detail.</p>

<p><b>Built-in DVD player</b></p>
<p>A side-mounted slot loading DVD player keeps the overall depth of the TV slim, yet still gives punchy colours, crisp detail and smooth motion</p>

<p><b>Two HDMIs plus USB</b></p>
<p>The 23/157 comes with a USB socket to let you playback video, audio and photos. Two HDMI sockets let you connect a Blu-ray player and an HD games console. Component (via included adaptor) and a PC socket are also included, while for private listening there's a headphone socket.</p>

<p><b>Good looking</b></p>
<p>Despite having a DVD player built-in, the Blaupunkt 23/157 is just 57mm thick: that's about half the depth of older LCD/DVD TVs. Finished in black and featuring classic, simple 'Blue Point' clean lines, the 23/157 boasts a timeless design.</p>

<p>Get yourself more for less, with the Blaupunkt 23/157.</p>"
