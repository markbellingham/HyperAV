SET prDescr_Long = "With a built-in DVD player, USB, twin HDMIs plus more, this famous German branded TV packs in a lot for a very modest price

LED backlight
Featuring LED backlighting, the Blaupunkt 23/157 creates a vivid picture with high contrast, giving enhanced colours and deep blacks. A wide viewing angle means you don't have to be square on, making it the perfect set for kitchens and those rooms where your viewing position changes.

The HD screen is just the thing for viewing Sky HD, Virgin HD or Freeview HD channels. Connect your TV set-top box via HDMI and you'll enjoy 720p HD-Ready TV with breath-taking clarity and detail.

Built-in DVD player
A side-mounted slot loading DVD player keeps the overall depth of the TV slim, yet still gives punchy colours, crisp detail and smooth motion

Two HDMIs plus USB
The 23/157 comes with a USB socket to let you playback video, audio and photos. Two HDMI sockets let you connect a Blu-ray player and an HD games console. Component (via included adaptor) and a PC socket are also included, while for private listening there's a headphone socket.

Good looking
Despite having a DVD player built-in, the Blaupunkt 23/157 is just 57mm thick: that's about half the depth of older LCD/DVD TVs. Finished in black and featuring classic, simple 'Blue Point' clean lines, the 23/157 boasts a timeless design.

Get yourself more for less, with the Blaupunkt 23/157."
