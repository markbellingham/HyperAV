SET prDescr_Long = "Matching up class-leading connectivity with comprehensive smart functionality, the LG 32LF580V is the perfect TV for the digital era.

Brilliant picture quality with 400 PMI for smooth motion
Although this is a smart TV that's packed with features it still puts the picture first. LG's 400 PMI (Picture Mastering Index) makes sure that the picture remains smooth and fluid, no matter how fast-paced the action gets. The LED screen also reveals intricate levels of detail, making it the perfect match for your Blu-ray player or HD games console.

Smart TV that includes all your favourite apps
The LG 32LF580V comes packed with useful apps that look great on the big screen. The BBC iPlayer, YouTube, Now TV, Demand 5 and Netflix are just some of the video on demand services that come as standard with the LG. There's also easy access to music sites like Spotify and Napster plus social sites Facebook and Twitter.

DLNA and Wi-Fi make this TV part of your home network
DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) compatibility means the 32LF580V will seamlessly blend with your home network. With DLNA you can stream music or video from your laptop, PC or NAS drive. Thanks built-in Wi-Fi, even connecting up is a breeze.

Three USBs and HDMIs for complete connectivity
No fewer than three USB sockets make the 32LF580V king of connectivity. These handy connections are perfect for hooking up your media devices and sharing photos, music and video. Matching this are three HDMI sockets; enough for a Blu-ray player, HD TV set-top box and HD games console. Throw in the SCART, component and composite sockets for your older devices and it's clear that the LG has the capacity to cope with even the most complicated systems going.

Bright and detailed sound
Although we'd always recommend a soundbar to make the most of the sound, the built in system is powerful enough to give clear and detailed sound. LG's popular Clear Voice II is on hand to help out with 'busy' and congested soundtracks where it can sometimes be tricky to make out dialogue

Sleek style
A slimline bezel and soundbar friendly feet make this TV look almost impressive off as when it's on. To make the most of that slim 56mm depth you can also wall mount it with an optional VESA type bracket.

If you want a TV with plentiful apps and a smooth picture, the LG 32LF580 is bound to impress."
