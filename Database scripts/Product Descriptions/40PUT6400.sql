SET prDescr_Long = "<p>With its top spec, including 4K UHD and Android Smart TV, the Philips 40PUT6400 offers simply sensational value.</p>

<p><b>4K Ultra HD for the maximum picture detail</b></p>
<p>For the most vivid detail and total realism, 4K UHD resolution is the future of TV. Packing in 4x the detail of Full HD, 4K UHD not only makes images clearer but also lets you watch a larger screen from a closer distance without losing out on clarity.</p>

<p><b>Unique Pixel Plus Ultra HD and 700Hz PMR for a brilliant picture quality</b></p>
<p>Making the most of the 4K resolution is Philips' Pixel Plus Ultra HD. Artefacts and noise from any source are detected and reduced. This creates super-sharp definition and ultra-low noise images for a more realistic picture. For an even smoother picture quality, Philips has added 700Hz PMR (Perfect Motion Rate) technology. This gives unprecedented sharpness and clarity with fast moving images and is ideal with sports events and action movies.</p>

<p><b>Android TV</b></p>
<p>Offering the slick interaction of the best smartphones, Android TV is one of the smartest content managers and providers on the market. Boasting features such as Google Cast, Google Play and Voice Search, this Philips 4K TV is just as entertaining as your smartphone or tablet.</p>

<p><b>Google Play and Google Cast</b></p>
<p>With Google Play, the Philips 40PUT6400 gives easy access to a massive array of entertainment. Use it to access all your favourite apps, including Spotify Connect, Netflix 4K, BBC iPlayer and YouTube, plus a huge range of games. Google Cast hooks up with your smartphone, tablet or computer for seamless content sharing.</p>

<p><b>Voice Search</b></p>
<p>Even with such a massive range of content, finding what you want is always easy. Voice Search means you simply say what you're looking for and let Android TV find it for you.</p>

<p><b>Style and functionality</b></p>
<p>This sleek TV doesn't just look good, it's practical, too. At a time when most TVs now come with fixed feet, the Philips excels with its elegant swivel base. Not only is this narrow enough to fit on stands and soundbases that others won't but it also swivels to give the ideal viewing angle.</p>

<p>Get yourself a top-spec TV for the price of an ordinary one, with the Philips 40PUT6400.</p>"
