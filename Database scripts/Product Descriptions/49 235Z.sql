SET prDescr_Long = "Enjoy a big, Full HD, screen for the price of a small one, with the Blaupunkt 49/235z.

Full 1080p High Definition with LED backlighting
At the heart of the Blaupunkt 49/235z is a Full HD1080p, D-LED backlit screen. Full HD 1080p resolution gets the very best from Blu-ray, gaming and other sources and gives lifelike detail and stunning realism. Even better, when viewed on the Blaupunkt's generous 49 inch screen, images really do 'come to life'.

Freeview HD for stunning realism
The 49 inch screen shows you the bigger picture but it's the built-in Freeview HD tuner that shows you the better one. With all the main channels now available in HD, watching TV is now more realistic than ever - for better or worse!

Three HDMIs and twin USBs
The Blaupunkt 49/235z may be great value but that doesn't stop it being well connected. It has three HDMI sockets, enabling you to connect an HD set-top box, Blu-ray player and HD games console. The two USB sockets will let you playback video, audio and photos via USB media devices and memory sticks.

Plenty of connections
There are also SCART, composite, component and VGA PC sockets, while for private listening you'll find a headphone socket. An optical digital output lets you plug the TV into a soundbar or base to improve the sound - matching the big picture with a big sound.

Smart new style
With its soundbar/base friendly feet, and super-slim bezel, the Blaupunkt 49/235z is right up there with current TV design trends. For a really neat look, use a VESA 200 compatible bracket and you can mount it on the wall.

Big screen, big value - the Blaupunkt 49/235z gives you more for less."
