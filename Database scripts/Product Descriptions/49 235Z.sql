<p><b>Full 1080p High Definition with LED backlighting</b></p>
<p>At the heart of the Blaupunkt 49/235z is a Full HD1080p, D-LED backlit screen. Full HD 1080p resolution gets the very best from Blu-ray, gaming and other sources and gives lifelike detail and stunning realism. Even better, when viewed on the Blaupunkt's generous 49 inch screen, images really do 'come to life'.</p>

<p><b>Freeview HD for stunning realism</b></p>
<p>The 49 inch screen shows you the bigger picture but it's the built-in Freeview HD tuner that shows you the better one. With all the main channels now available in HD, watching TV is now more realistic than ever - for better or worse!</p>

<p><b>Three HDMIs and twin USBs</b></p>
<p>The Blaupunkt 49/235z may be great value but that doesn't stop it being well connected. It has three HDMI sockets, enabling you to connect an HD set-top box, Blu-ray player and HD games console. The two USB sockets will let you playback video, audio and photos via USB media devices and memory sticks.</p>

<p><b>Plenty of connections</b></p>
<p>There are also SCART, composite, component and VGA PC sockets, while for private listening you'll find a headphone socket. An optical digital output lets you plug the TV into a soundbar or base to improve the sound - matching the big picture with a big sound.</p>

<p><b>Smart new style</b></p>
<p>With its soundbar/base friendly feet, and super-slim bezel, the Blaupunkt 49/235z is right up there with current TV design trends. For a really neat look, use a VESA 200 compatible bracket and you can mount it on the wall.</p>

<p>Big screen, big value - the Blaupunkt 49/235z gives you more for less.</p>"
