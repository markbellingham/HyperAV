The highest standard from DTS - DTS:X
Due via software update from late 2015, the AVRX3200W is ready for DTS:X. DTS:X is DTS's flagship processor and pushes the boundaries of what you can expect from home cinema. This highly sophisticated processor renders images in three dimensions that conventional processing can't match. It also offers other advantages such as the ability to boost the spatial effect of conventional DTS and easily adapts with your existing speaker configuration.

High Resolution audio compatible USB interface
As a step up from the junior models in the Denon range, the AVRX3200W features a USB interface that's compatible with not just Apple iOS devices but also High Resolution audio files from your computer or USB drive. Compatible with a wide range of file types, including DSD (2.8MHz) and FLAC lossless up to 24-bit/192kHz, the AVRX3200W is just as serious about sound as it is video.

Fully equipped for 4K

Enhanced connectivity
