<p><b>Engineered for Dolby Atmos and DTS-X</b></p>
<p>Due via software update from late 2015, the AVRX4200W is ready for DTS:X. DTS's flagship processor pushes the boundaries of what you can expect from home cinema. This highly sophisticated processor renders images in three dimensions that conventional processing can't match. Optimised for Dolby Atmos, you can now experience the wonder of Dolby Atmos in your own home. Producing a multi-dimensional and totally immersive sound, Dolby Atmos takes surround sound to another level.</p>

Compatible with a wide range of file types, including DSD (2.8MHz) and FLAC lossless up to 24-bit/192kHz, the AVRX4200W is just as serious about sound as it is video.</p>

<p><b>Fully equipped for 4K</b></p>
The AVRX4200W features the latest HDMI connections and supports HDCP 2.2, which means you can stream UltraHD video and that it's ready for the next generation of 4K discs. It's also equipped with 4K upscaling, giving you the most detailed picture on your 4K TV from all sources. The HDMI sockets allow 4K pass-through, for hassle free switching and viewing without the receiver needing to be turned on.</p>

<p><b>Three zone multi-room functionality</b></p>
<p>The Denon AVRX4200W offers playback in three zones, for comprehensive multi-room entertainment. Both passive and active 3 Zone outputs are standard, for complete speaker flexibility. It also provides independent HDMI outputs (2+1). This means you can run audio and video to another screen, in another room independently from the two main outputs. An RS232 socket and twin DC triggers make this receiver ideal for more complex home installation systems.</p>

<p><b>Enhanced connectivity, including phono stage</b></p>
<p>The AVRX4200W takes the strong connectivity of the AVRX3200W model and improves upon it still further. As well as the extra HDMI output and additional audio/video connections, it also comes with an MM phono stage as standard.
