SET prDescr_Long = "Covering all the basics and doing them well, the Denon AVRX520BT is a quality introduction to the joys of home cinema.

Engaging sound
As you'd expect from one of the world's leading hi-fi companies, the AVR-X520BT has been designed with sound quality as a priority. At the heart of this Denon AV receiver is fully discrete amplification. By using discrete (separate) components rather than an IC chip, quality components can be used for a more detailed sound quality. With around 75watts for each channel, the AVRX520BT sounds far more engaging than a typical TV. Thanks to a Compressed Audio Restorer feature, the Denon also enhances the sound of lower bit rate audio, such as MP3s and audio from online videos.

Connect up with Bluetooth
With built-in Bluetooth, it's not just cinema sound that's given a boost but music from your smartphone or tablet, too. There's even a dedicated Denon app that makes streaming music from your device to receiver even easier.

4K pass through and HDCP 2.2 compatible HDMI sockets
Although it's Denon most simple AV receiver, the AVRX520BT still comes with the latest connectivity. It features 4K compatible HDMI sockets with HDCP 2.2, meaning you can stream UltraHD video and that it's ready for the next generation of UHD 4K discs. With five HDMI inputs (three compatible with HDCP 2.2) and an output for your TV, even pretty complex systems are well catered for.

Designed for simplicity
Connecting up an AV receiver for the first time can be a daunting experience; but not with the Denon AVRX520BT. All the inputs at the rear are clearly labelled and easy to locate. Once wired up, the Setup Assistant via onscreen display makes the final steps easy to complete. A speaker calibration microphone is included and means you get the very best sound possible with the least hassle.

Bring a taste of the cinema home and have the bonus of freeing the music on your smartphone, with the multi-tasking Denon AVRX520BT."
