SET prDescr_Long = "Speaker legends don't get much bigger than the Wharfedale Diamond 9.0.

The original small hi-fi speaker
It's hard to believe that the original Wharfedale Diamond is now past its thirtieth birthday. All those decades ago, it was the Diamond speaker that proved, for the first time, that excellent quality sound could be achieved from a small, budget speaker. Since then there have been dozens of imitators, but the Diamonds remain amongst the best available.

Solid construction
The cabinet isn't just compact, it's also very solid. This combination gives the Diamonds an extremely accurate sound quality as the cabinet doesn't flex or vibrate. Equally impressive are the drive units. A soft dome tweeter gives the clarity and smoothness of sound you'd expect from a more expensive speaker, while the woofer cone uses a carbon fibre type weave to offer extremely taut and responsive bass.

Surprisingly powerful
With a front port, these bass reflex speakers are punchier than you might expect and in no way could they ever be described as tinny. Over all, they may be small but the sound is grown-up, with excellent staging, realism and surprisingly powerful.

Hi-fi connections
It's not just the major aspects of the design that Wharfedale have got right, it's the details, too. Proper 4mm banana sockets will accept thick cable and offer the best type of connection. Threaded sockets at the rear make for secure and easy bracket attachment.

At Â£100 these speakers were clearly market leaders. Now we're offering them at this bargain price, the Diamond 9.0 speakers are a gem of a deal!"
