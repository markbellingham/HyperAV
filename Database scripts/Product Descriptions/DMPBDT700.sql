SET prDescr_Long = "<p>If you value sound and picture above all else, then check out one of the finest Blu-ray players in its class - the Panasonic DMPBDT700EB9.</p>

<p><b>4K 60P output and 4K direct Chroma upscaling</b></p>
<p>With 4K TVs now making their presence felt, finding a Blu-ray player that can make the most of them is well worth doing. With its 4K 60p (HDMI 2.0) output and up-scaling, the Panasonic DMPBDT700EB9 is just such a player. The Uniphier LSI Chip converts Blu-ray to 4K in the most accurate way possible. Both detail and colour accuracy are improved making sure you get the very best from your existing Blu-ray connection. With the 4K JPEG output, you can replay 4K material recorded on your camcorder or phone by using the USB or SD card slots.</p>

<p><b>Class-leading picture quality</b></p>
<p>Whether you use the 4K or not, the Panasonic DMP-BDT700EB9 is amongst the very best for picture quality. Block, Random and Mosquito Noise Reduction systems provide a clean and crisp image. Deep Color and x.v.Color compatibility ensure the highest levels of realism are possible. With 3D compatibility, including 2D-3D Conversion and 3D Effect Controller, the DMPBDT700eb9 also gets the very best from your 3D discs.</p>

<p><b>Audio enhancements for superior sound quality</b></p>
<p>With high-precision analogue audio processing by four independent 192kHz 32bit audio DACs (Digital to Analogue Convertors), the DMPBDT700eb9 gives a level of clarity and detail that lesser players can't hope to match. These DACs offer not only the most accurate and precise sound quality but also the ability to playback High Resolution audio files. Capable of playing FLAC or WAV files in 192kHz/24bit resolution (stereo) and FLAC at 96kHz/24bit (5.1 surround sound), the DMPBDT700eb9 offers true audiophile sound quality.</p>

<p><b>The most comprehensive connectivity including twin HDMI sockets</b></p>
<p>For home cinema fans one of the best features are the twin HDMI sockets. This offers separate feeds to AV receiver and TV - ideal if your AV receiver doesn't have 3D pass through. Another unique feature to this range-topping Panasonic is the analogue 7.1 RCA output. This lets you connect to older AV receivers that may not have an HDMI interface. With wi-fi built-in you can make the most of the Panasonic's improved network capability by linking to your system wirelessly. Other great connections include both SD card and USB inputs for full compatibility with a wide range of digital media.</p>

<p><b>Enhanced networking</b></p>
<p>The Panasonic DMP-BDT700eb9 comes with a comprehensive range of networking options, including a full web browser, as standard. It also brings you the best of the Internet with built-in apps for BBC iPlayer, Netflix, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. What's more, with the ability to playback Video On Demand (VOD) in High Resolution, your online viewing experience should be every bit as engaging as with other HD sources.</p>

<p><b>Streaming and Miracast</b></p>
<p>DLNA compatibility ensures you can link up with other sources on your network, for smooth streaming of content from PCs, laptops, NAS drives and other networked devices. Miracast allows you to stream whatever video is playing on your smartphone, tablet or PC to the TV, via the Blu-ray player, wirelessly (Miracast requires a Wi-Fi network and Miracast certified smartphone. Smartphone firmware update may be required). For easy connection, a Wi-Fi output is also standard.</p>

<p><b>Superior build quality</b></p>
<p>As you'd expect from a range-topping Panasonic, the DMPBDT700eb9 offers superb construction quality and finish. A drop down front panel, with rounded edges offers a very clean and sophisticated style. The brushed aluminium finish used throughout also confirms this player's position at the very top of the range - both in terms of performance and style.</p>

<p>For the ultimate in Blu-ray performance, both now and in the future, the Panasonic DMP-BDT700eb9 has it covered.</p>"
