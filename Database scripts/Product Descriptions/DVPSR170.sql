SET prDescr_Long = "The Sony DVPSR170 is top branded DVD player, giving you quality sound and vision for less.

Crisp, sharp picture
Using a 12-bit video DAC, the Sony DVPSR170 offers a superb picture, with deep blacks and natural colour. Added to this, Custom Picture Mode and Picture Sharpness control ensure you not only a crisp picture but can also adapt the picture to your exact requirements.

Plenty of playback options
The Sony DVP-SR170 is a flexible performer when it comes to playback. In addition to being able to play SVCD, DVD+R DL and pretty much any other blank disc format, this Sony DVD player will also play the popular Xivd format. It also offers text information on CD playback.

Compact dimensions
Measuring just 270 x 207 x 39mm, this cute Sony DVD player takes up very little space. Featuring Sony's typically slick styling, it also looks a world apart from the very basic 'supermarket specials' more usually available at this price.

Ideal for a second room or when space is tight, this top value Sony DVD player brings quality for less."
