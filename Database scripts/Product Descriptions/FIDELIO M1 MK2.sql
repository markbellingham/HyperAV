Closed back for life on the move
To naturally reduce outside noise and also prevent others from hearing your music, the Philips Fidelio M1 Mk2 headphones are closed back. The acoustically sealed construction keeps the detail in, without sounding claustrophobic.

Designed for a natural sound
The Philips Fidelio M1 Mk2 headphones have been designed for a sound that's as close to the original as possible. Advanced, double-layered ear pieces drastically reduce resonance and vibration, for a natural sound at all volume levels. Powerful 40mm neodymium drivers give a solid bass that remains true to the original performers. Thanks to the bass reflex design these headphones manage to reach low bass notes, even when powered by portable devices.

Quality construction
Made from quality materials like real leather and aluminium, the M1 Mk2's don't just feel good, they're built to withstand the knocks and bumps of a live on the move. The stylish good looks are also more likely to stay that way with a faux suede pouch that offers protection when not in use.

Long term comfort
Mixing fabric and leather, the Fidelio M1 ear pads feel just right. The breathable covers combine with memory foam for a comfortable and ergonomic fit. They also help in sealing the sound in, ensuring you hear every detail.

Multi-tasking
So that you can still accept calls on your smartphone, the Philips Fidelio M1 comes with an inline microphone and pick-up button. Compatible with many phones, including those from Apple, BlackBerry, HTC, LG and Motorola these headphones let you flow from music to talk with ease.

Combining superb sound and comfort, the Philips M1 Mk2 make every journey a pleasure."
