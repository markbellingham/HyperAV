SET prDescr_Long = "<p>Offering superb value for money but all the performance and style you'd expect from Sony, the HTCT60BT soundbar is the perfect way to enhance your TV's sound.</p>

<p><b>VIRTUAL SURROUND FOR A SPACIOUS SOUND</b></p>
<p>The Sony HT-CT60BT gives a great boost to your TV's sound quality. By using good quality speakers within a dedicated cabinet, the sound is more realistic, broader and dynamic than typical TV speakers. Thanks to built-in Virtual Surround sound, the sound is also enveloping, giving you a feel of the full surround sound thrill.</p>

<p><b>POWERFUL BASS FROM A DEDICATED SUBWOOFER</b></p>
<p>A separate subwoofer frees up the soundbar from the compromise of doing two jobs at once. Instead it remains dedicated to the task of providing a holographic 3D sound stage, leaving the subwoofer free to provide deep, cinema-like bass. Using a dedicated 30 watt amplifier, the subwoofer has enough grunt to drive along soundtracks with real vigour.</p>

<p><b>STREAM MUSIC VIA NFC BLUETOOTH</b></p>
<p>Using NFC Bluetooth technology, you can connect up just about any smartphone, tablet or newer laptop, Mac or PC and stream your music. With compatible NFC devices, simply hold the unit next to the soundbar and you're good to stream. With Bluetooth you pair your device in the usual way. Once done, you'll be able to stream music from your stored library or from streaming music services such as Spotify or Last.fm.</p>

<p><b>SLEEK GOOD LOOKS AND WALL MOUNTABLE</b></p>
<p>Unlike other budget soundbars, the Sony HTCT60BT looks anything but. Its stylish hexagonal profile not only reduces the visual bulk of the unit but also helps in providing a more spacious sound stage. For enhanced flexibility a wall mountable bracket is also included - ideal if you already have your TV wall mounted. The separate subwoofer is finished in discreet matte black and can be easily tucked out of sight.</p>

<p>Enjoy the powerful sound that your TV simply can't reproduce, with the Sony HTCT60BT.</p>"
