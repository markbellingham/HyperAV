SET prDescr_Long = "Experience the thrill of the cinema, with the Sony HTCT80 soundbar and subwoofer package.

Powerful sub, separate slim soundbar
By putting the bass unit in a separate subwoofer, the Sony HTCT80 soundbar has the freedom to be one of the slimmest in its class. Thanks to Virtual Surround Sound it still manages to give a spacious and immersive sound with that separate subwoofer providing the rumble. Unlike the sound from your TV, with the Sony HTCT80 you can now feel the action rather than just seeing it.

S- Master digital amp and wireless streaming
Acting as the perfect complement for the dynamic speaker system is Sony's S-Master HX digital amplifier. Designed with simplicity in mind, the result is not only more power but also significantly less distortion. When you combine Bluetooth with NFC, streaming your music becomes easier than ever. Simply swipe your smartphone for NFC pairing alongside, or use standard Bluetooth pairing if your phone's not NFC equipped.

USB port
Got a music collection saved on a USB stick, MP3, smartphone or tablet? Then you can get quick and easy access with the Sony's USB port. Handily mounted at the front of the unit, connecting up your device is quick and easy. Once connected, the Sony's remote allows easy access to enjoying High-Resolution Audio across all of your devices.

Stylishly slim
Standing just 52mm tall, the HTCT80's low profile won't block your TV's image. In some cases, the soundbar may even be able to be slid under the TV (depending on TV stand design). Alternatively, the soundbar can easily be wall mounted for an equally discreet look.

For a big sound from a discreet package, let the Sony HTCT80 transform your home entertainment."
