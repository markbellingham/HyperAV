SET prDescr_Long = "<p>Join the Atmos home cinema revolution with the great value, easy to use Onkyo HTS5805.</p>

<p><b>Engineered for Dolby Atmos sound</b></p>
<p>With both AV receiver and speaker package optimised for Dolby Atmos, you can be amongst the first in the world to experience the wonder of Dolby Atmos in your own home. Producing a multi-dimensional and totally immersive sound, Dolby Atmos has been hailed as the greatest advance in surround sound for 20 years - so don't miss out!</p>

<p><b>Perfectly matched speakers</b></p>
<p>The matching speaker pack has been carefully selected as the best match for this AV receiver. Dolby Atmos works incredibly well at presenting sounds overhead, such as rain falling, helicopters or the flight of an arrow. To accurately reproduce these effects, angled speakers are contained within the front speakers. These drivers, which are powered by the receiver's height channels, bounce sound effects off the ceiling for a fully immersive sound.</p>

<p><b>Transform the sound of your home entertainment</b></p>
<p>Using Onkyo's WRAT (Wide Range Amplifier Technology), the HTS5805 delivers knock-out sound with your movies, gaming and music. For signal purity, Onkyo use a discrete amplifier circuit rather than an inferior IC chip. Other signs of top quality electronics include the Burr Brown DAC (Digital to Analogue Convertor). Taken together, it's little wonder the HTS5805 is one of the best-sounding AV packages in its class.</p>

<p><b>The latest connections</b></p>
<p>As well as the latest Dolby Atmos processing ability, the HTS5805 also comes with the most up-to-date connectivity. The HTS5805 features the latest HDMI 2.0a connections and supports HDCP 2.2, which means you can stream UltraHD video and that it's ready for the next generation of 4K discs.</p>

<p><b>Stream music from your mobile with Bluetooth</b></p>
<p>With a Bluetooth receiver built in, it's easy to enjoy your music from other devices. Pair with your smartphone, tablet, laptop or PC and wirelessly stream all your favourite music. With the possibility of streaming music services, such as Spotify, Deezer and Tidal, as well as your own music library, you get access to near unlimited music! Advanced Music Optimiser improves the dynamic response from compressed music sources, adding 'sparkle' to the sound and restoring the sound quality.</p>

<p><b>Ready for your streaming media player</b></p>
<p>Not only does the Onkyo HTS5805 feature an HDMI input for your choice of media player, it also has a dedicated USB power supply for it. Keep up with your video subscription services and other programs streamed from the Internet with ease.</p>

<p><b>Getting started made easy</b></p>
<p>Connecting up a home cinema system for the first time can be a daunting experience: but not with the Onkyo! Take a look at the back panel and you'll see all the inputs clearly and individually labelled, making set-up a logical process. Once wired up, an overlaid, on-screen display set-up via HDMI makes getting started easy.</p>

<p>For Atmos home cinema that's more easily accessible than ever, checking out the Onkyo HTS5805.</p>"
