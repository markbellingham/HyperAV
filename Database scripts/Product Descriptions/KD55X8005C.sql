4K Ultra HD TV for the ultimate resolution
With its screen resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels, the Sony KD55X8005CBU is all set for the 4K UHD revolution. Its resolution is four times greater than conventional 1920 x 1080 Full HD TV and it's a difference you'll really notice, and even up close up the detail and realism are awesome. Even with other resolutions, the KD55X8005CBU takes advantage of Sony's 4K X-Reality PRO technology to upscale the images to 4K - making the most of every format.

Motionflow XR 200Hz for fast action
Standard with this TV is Sony's motion control - Motionflow XR 200Hz. The Motionflow system works especially well with fast moving action, such as sports events, without the blur you can see with standard TVs. From a Hollywood blockbuster to a Formula One race, XR200 makes all the difference.

Android TV for a Smarter TV experience
Offering the slick interaction of the best smartphones, Android TV is one of the smartest content managers and providers. Boasting features such as Google Cast, Google Play and Voice Search, this Sony is part TV and part giant smartphone!

Google Play and Google Cast
With Google Play, the Sony KD55X8005CBU gives easy access to a massive array of entertainment. Use it to access all your favourite apps, including BBC iPlayer, Netflix and YouTube, plus a huge range of games. Google Cast hooks up with your Android smartphone or tablet for seamless content sharing, while Photo Sharing Plus lets up to ten mobile Android or iOS devices see your pics.

Signal-to-Sound-Architecture for enhanced sound
Although no match for a soundbar or base, the Sony KD55X8005CBU 's sound system is one of the better ones. At its heart is Sony's Signal-to-Sound Architecture. This digital signal processing system encompasses a number of technologies that help to provide crystal clear sound quality. S-Force Front Surround creates a more spacious sound while Clear Phase produces a more even and natural sound quality.

As an exciting entry to the joys of 4K TV, the Sony KD55X8005CBU is a star performer."
