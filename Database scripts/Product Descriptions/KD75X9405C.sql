SET prDescr_Long = "<p><b>THE HIGHEST SPEC PANEL WITH LOCAL DIMMING AND X-TENDED DYNAMIC RANGE PRO FOR AMAZING REALISM!</b></p>
<p>At the heart of the Sony's impressive picture quality is an LED panel with Local Dimming. Local dimming gives much more precise control over the panel's backlighting. In turn, this means that darker sections can be less brightly lit, giving a dynamic contrast that's simply not possible with less effective backlighting. The Sony KD75X9405CBU also makes use of X-tended Dynamic Range PRO. This enhanced processor uses backlighting algorithms to let you see three times the brightness range of standard LED TVs. Add in other image enhancers such as Deep Black and OptiContrast for added realism and it soon becomes clear that the Sony KD75X9405CBU takes image quality very seriously.</p>

<p><b>4K ULTRA HD TV - THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION</b></p>
<p>With its revealing screen resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels, the Sony KD75X9405CBU is all set for the 4K UHD revolution. This resolution is exactly four times greater than the more conventional 1920 x 1080 Full HD TVs and it's a difference you can see of the Sony's huge screen - big time! The gain in resolution is especially noticeable and, even when close up to the screen, the detail and realism is awesome. As 4K streaming becomes ever more available, including on popular TV series streamed over the Internet, the benefits are now clearer than ever. Yet, even with other resolutions, the KD75X9405CBU takes advantage of Sony's X-Reality PRO 4K technology to upscale the images to 4K - making the most of every format.</p>

<p><b>MOTIONFLOW XR1200HZ FOR THE SMOOTHEST MOTION POSSIBLE</b></p>
<p>Also standard with this Sony 4K 75' TV is Sony's top-end motion control - Motionflow XR 1200Hz. This range-topping Motionflow system works especially well with fast moving action, such as sports events, without the blur you can see with standard TVs. From a Hollywood blockbuster to a Formula One race, XR1200 makes a huge difference.</p>

<p><b>ACTIVE 3D FOR A THRILLING EXPERIENCE</b></p>
<p>Once you've experienced 3D TV, ordinary TV just never seems quite the same. Images aren't just projected forward but appear to occupy the space behind the screen, too. This gives images an amazing depth that has never been possible with 2D TV. Thanks to 3D active processing, the Sony KD-75X9405CBU offers breathtaking levels of detail and realism.</p>

<p><b>THE ULTIMATE TV SOUND</b></p>
<p>Although no match for a separates home cinema system or soundbar/base, Sony has put everything it knows into improving the sound from flatscreen TVs with this range-topping model. Beginning with the speakers, the KD75X9405CBU uses a 2.2 system for powerful and dynamic sound. Using two subwoofers that are additional to the standard 2-way speakers, the TV produces a remarkably strong bass from the constraints of a slim TV. Magnetic Fluid Speakers produce a punchy and dynamic sound that's also easy to decipher - making it easier to hear dialogue during complex action scenes. Powering this impressive speaker array is Sony's top-end TV amplifier. The S-Master HX Digital amp with S-Force PRO Front Surround not only gives greater power but also a more enveloping and spacious sound than lesser models.</p>

<p><b>ANDROID TV FOR A BRIGHTER SMART TV EXPERIENCE</b></p>
<p>Offering the slick interaction of the best smartphones, Android TV is one of the smartest content managers and providers to date. Boasting features such as Google Cast, Google Play and Voice Search, this Sony is part TV and part giant smartphone!</p>

<p><b>GOOGLE PLAY AND CAST</b></p>
<p>With Google Play onboard, the Sony KD75X9405CBU offers effortless access to a massive array of entertainment. Access all your favourite apps from Google Play, including favourite VOD services such as the BBC iPlayer, Netflix and YouTube. You also get access to a huge range of games, with the option of dedicated control pads for the total gaming experience.

With Google Cast you can share whatever's on your smartphone screen, including photos, videos and games. In addition to this, Photo Sharing Plus lets you share photos and videos with up to ten mobile Android or iOS devices.</p>

<p><b>VOICE SEARCH AND ONE FLICK ENTERTAINMENT FOR EASY NAVIGATION</b></p>
<p>With such a massive range of content, finding what you want is not always easy. Fortunately, with Voice Search you simply need to say what you're looking for and let Android TV find it for you. Alternatively, one-flick entertainment gives effortless control of search functions via simple swipes on the remote's touch pad. Best of all, you can control all the major functions without your TV viewing being interrupted - thanks to the discreet pop-up menus.</p>

<p>If you're looking for the best Sony has to offer then you need look no further. The Sony KD75X9405C is simply scintillating!</p>"
