SET prDescr_Long = "<p>With its built-in DVD player, the Sharp LC32DHE4041K is the perfect space saving package.</p>

<p><b>Smooth picture with LED and Active Motion 100</b></p>
<p>Thanks to Active Motion 100, this Sharp TV offers smooth motion, that's free from excessive blur on fast moving images. Ideal for both sports events and action movies, Active Motion 100 simply means superior clarity for more of the time. With its Full LED backlighting, the Sharp LC32DHE4041K offers a dynamic picture quality with high contrast creating deep blacks. Colours are enhanced, too, giving the picture a greater sense of depth and realism.</p>

<p><b>Built-in DVD player</b></p>
<p>The built-in DVD player is similarly impressive. Side-mounted slot loading keeps the overall depth of the TV slim, yet the performance is anything but. Punchy colours, crisp detail and smooth motion; the DVD performance is every bit as composed as you'd expect from a Sharp DVD player.</p>

<p><b>Freeview HD tuner built-in</b></p>
<p>This Sharp 32' TV also comes equipped with a built-in Freeview HD tuner. If you don't use a subscription service such as Sky, Virgin or BT then this tuner gets you access to HD TV via your aerial with no subscription fees. Perfect for a second room or where you can't access TV by any means other than an aerial, the LC32DHE4041K brings you High Definition TV at no extra cost.</p>

<p><b>Record your favourite programmes via USB</b></p>
<p>This well-equipped budget TV also comes with a PVR USB socket. PVR (Personal Video Recorder) means that you can hook up a USB recording device, such as hard drive or memory stick and record TV programmes using the EPG (Electronic Programme portfolio). The system even lets you pause live TV; just as you can with premium subscription services.</p>

<p><b>USB Digital Media Player</b></p>
<p>Featuring not one but two USB connections, the Sharp lets you plug in both recording and playback devices. The intuitive Media Player makes playing back photos, music and videos an easy and hassle-free process.</p>

<p><b>Flexible connectivity with three HDMI sockets</b></p>
<p>The LC32DHE4041K also scores with its three HDMI sockets. Enough for a Blu-ray player, set-top box and games console, the Sharp copes with ease. For older sources, it has mini component, composite and even a VGA PC input. The D-sub 15 pin PC input makes the Sharp ideal for use with an older computer.</p>

<p>Combining a top performance with great value, the Sharp LC32DHE4041K is an all-inclusive entertainer.</p>"
