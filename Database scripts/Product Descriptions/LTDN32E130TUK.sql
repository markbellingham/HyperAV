See more of the picture with HD TV
The Hisense LHD32E130TUK makes the most of your High Definition content with its HD Ready screen. The LED screen offers excellent detail and a more life-like picture than standard TVs. A fast response time of 6.5ms also helps reduce blur for sharper images, even when the on-screen action gets intense.

Freeview HD tuner built-in
Unlike many of its rivals, this Hisense 32' TV comes equipped with a built-in Freeview HD tuner. If you don't use a subscription service such as Sky, Virgin or BT then this tuner gets you access to HD TV via your aerial with no subscription fees. Perfect for a second room or where you can't access TV by any means other than an aerial, the LHD32E130TUK brings you High Definition TV at no extra cost.

USB Digital Media Player
Featuring not one but two USB connections, the Hisense lets you plug in both recording and playback devices. The intuitive Media Player makes playing back photos, music and videos an easy and hassle-free process.

Flexible connectivity with three HDMI sockets
The LHD32E130TUK also scores over its rivals in offering three HDMI sockets. Enough for a Blu-ray player, set-top box and games console, the Hisense copes with ease. For older sources, it has SCART, component, composite and even a VGA PC input. The VGA PC input is pretty rare these days and makes the Hisense ideal for use with any older PCs you may have.

Packing in more for less, the Hisense LHD32E130TUK simply makes sense."
