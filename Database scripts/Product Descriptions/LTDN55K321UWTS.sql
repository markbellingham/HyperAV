SET prDescr_long = "<p>A big screen beauty with fabulous 4K for less than you might think, the Hisense LTDN55K321UWTSEU redefines big screen 4K value</p>

<p><b>Fabulous 4K</b></p>
<p>This Hisense is our best value 4K TV to date and it's a stunner. With four times the resolution of Full 1080p HD, 4K (UHD) TV offers stunning detail and resolution for totally life-like realism. Even without a native 4K UHD signal, UHD upscaling means that you can scale up an ordinary HD signal to make the best of the screen. Get Netflix 4K or other 4K content and the image just keeps getting better.</p>

<p><b>Serious Smart spec</b></p>
<p>Packing a Quad Core processor, the Hisense is a powerful performer with Smart content, too. Connect up to your home network by Ethernet or Wi-Fi and enjoy access to a wide range of apps including favourites such as Netflix, YouTube, Twitter and BBC iPlayer. A built-in web browser and DLNA compatibility lets you browse and stream to your heart's content.</p>

<p><b>Completely connected</b></p>
<p>Four HDMI sockets means this TV is every bit as well connected as the big-name TVs. Two of these sockets are the latest HDMI 2.0 version and the Hisense is also compatible with HEVC, meaning that it can stream Netflix 4K with ease. Other connections include no fewer than three USB sockets, one of which is the latest USB 3.0 version for a high speed link. Throw in an optical connection for a soundbar/base and you've got everything you need in a 4K TV.</p>

<p><b>Fantastic Freeview HD</b></p>
<p>It might be some way behind 4K, but Freeview HD is still a huge step-up on regular Freeview TV. If you're not using Sky, Virgin, BT or another digital TV provider, Freeview HD is the way to go for free-to-access digital TV through your existing aerial. Compared to standard Freeview, images are far more detailed, with rich colour and enhanced realism.</p>

<p><b>PVR USB</b></p>
<p>One of the USB sockets lets you connect up a USB memory stick to use as a PVR. PVR stands for Personal Video Recorder and lets you record TV programmes via the set's Electronic Programme portfolio. It can also pause live TV - just like a subscription based set-top box.</p>

<p>Redefining 4K TV value, the Hisense LTDN55K321UWTSEU simply can't be matched at this price.</p>"
