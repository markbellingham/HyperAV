SET prDescr_Long = "<p>For hi-fi quality outdoor sound, the Yamaha NSAW592 speakers are an ideal choice.</p>

<p><b>Water and UV-resistant</b></p>
<p>Featuring all-weather construction, the Yamaha NS-AW592 speakers have been specially designed to suit harsher, outdoor conditions. The weather-proof cabinets are water and UV resistant, and designed to withstand extremes in temperature.</p>

<p><b>Shape gives flexible positioning</b></p>
<p>Adding to their appeal is the unique shape and mounting possibilities. The wedge shape makes it possible to mount the NSAW592 speakers under eves, in corners, or even facing up from the floor. The supplied bracket makes these extremely flexible and easy to position just about anywhere.</p>

<p><b>Taking hi-fi outdoors</b></p>
<p>Not only are drive units water-resistant, but separate woofers and tweeters ensure a crisp top end with plenty of detail. The woofer has been specifically tuned to sound at its best in an outdoor environment with high clarity and a bass response stronger than the compact dimensions suggest. The curved front baffle helps project the sound from a variety of mounting positions and also is designed to aid alignment between the drive units for a cohesive and 'complete' sound.</p>

<p><b>Fill the patio with music</b></p>
<p>At 88dB, the NS-AW592 is easy for most amps to drive. Their larger size over the NS-AW392s also makes them ideal for larger spaces, so if you've a patio, hot-tub area, or any other outdoor space where you'd appreciate a little music, look no further than these Yamaha outdoor speakers.</p>"
