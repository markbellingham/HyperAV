SET prDescr_Long = "<p>The perfect match for Dolby Atmos enabled AV receivers; the Pioneer S-B73A-LR speakers reach new heights in sound!</p>

<p><b>DOLBY ATMOS ENABLED DESIGN</b></p>
<p>Optimised for Dolby Atmos, you can now experience the wonder of Dolby Atmos via quality, home speakers. Equipped with upward firing CST speakers, the Pioneer S-BS73A-LR speakers have been tailor made for Atmos sound. Producing a multi-dimensional and totally immersive sound, Dolby Atmos has been hailed as the greatest advance in surround sound for 20 years - so don't miss out!</p>

<p><b>COHERENT SOURCE TRANSDUCER FOR INCREDIBLE, 3D-LIKE SOUND</b></p>
<p>Developed by Pioneer themselves, the CST (Coherent Source Transducer) speakers are used to fire sound upwards from each cabinet. With the tweeter placed centrally within the woofer unit, the sound comes from a shared, coaxial central point, giving a clear and precise soundstage. Aluminium woofer units are matched to soft dome tweeters, creating the ideal combination of a crisp mid-range and smooth treble.</p>

<p><b>HIGH QUALITY 3-WAY DESIGN</b></p>
<p>Designed by Pioneer's speaker chief, Andrew Jones, the Pioneer SBS73ALR's are truly special speakers. In addition to the CST drive units at the top, they also feature second CST units at the front plus a dedicated bass unit; making these genuine 3-way speakers. What this means is that the treble, mid-range and bass all benefit from dedicated drive units. With each frequency faithfully reproduced, the Pioneers' offer exceptional clarity across the frequency range.</p>

<p><b>POWERFUL BASS</b></p>
<p>The aluminium bass cones benefit from over-sized voice coils and long-throw excursions leading to high power handling and a taut, dynamic sound quality. Although compact in size, the powerful bass response belies the size of cone and cabinet. With carefully designed porting, Pioneer has also ensured low cabinet colouration for a precise and accurate sound.</p>

<p>Ideal for use as front or rear speakers, the Pioneer S-BS73A-LR set new standards for Dolby Atmos surround within a single speaker. Prepare to be enveloped by sound!</p>"
