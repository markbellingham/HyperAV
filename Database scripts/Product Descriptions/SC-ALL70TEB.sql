SET prDescr_Long = "The Panasonic SC-ALL70TEB is a soundbar with a difference. Featuring Panasonic's SC-ALL wireless multi-room technology it's a great wireless music speaker as well as an impressive soundbar for your TV.

The Panasonic ALL system
The Panasonic ALL system is an easy-to-use, high quality, wireless multi-room system. Made up of active speaker units and the ALL1C network connector, streaming music around your home couldn't be easier. Simply join any ALL device to your home Wi-Fi network and then wirelessly stream your stored music library or music services, such as Spotify, from your smartphone or tablet.

Flexible playback
With such ease of use you can switch from listening to music on your headphones when you come home, to music around the house with barely a break in the tune. With the ALL system you can listen to different music from different sources in other rooms or play the same music all around the house with Party Mode.

A huge improvement in TV sound
Featuring a powerful 350 watt amp and quality speaker system, the SC-ALL70TEB gives a powerful, room-filling sound. The difference between the Panasonic and the vast majority of TVs is night and day in terms of sound quality. With a multi-angle speaker layout, the sound is also broader and far more spacious than your average TV, too.

Powerful bass from the wireless subwoofer
The separate subwoofer uses a downward firing cone to add impact to movie soundtracks and high drama events. It also features a wireless connection, making it easy to tuck out of the way, without having to consider where to put the trailing cables.

Make it wireless 5.1 with two SC-ALL2eb's
For an even more immersive sound, simply add two Panasonic SC-ALL2eb speakers at the rear of your room. This transforms the playback from 3.1 to surround sound 5.1; and all without the hassle of speaker cables! With a 5.1 surround sound system you can enjoy Dolby and DTS encoded movies exactly as the producer intended - in glorious surround sound.

Stream music via NFC Bluetooth
If you can't connect your mobile device to your wi-fi network you can still stream music via Bluetooth. Using NFC (Near Field Connection) and Bluetooth technology, you can connect up just about any smartphone, tablet or newer laptop, Mac or PC and stream your music. With compatible NFC devices simply swipe the unit over the soundbar and you're good to stream.

HDMI with ARC for system flexibility
With an HDMI input you can connect up your Blu-ray player, DVD or games console with the best quality digital connection. Thanks to ARC (Audio Return Channel) you also only need a single HDMI cable between soundbar and TV to hear the sound from the TV's onboard receiver. The HDMI connection is also compatible with 4K and the HDCP 2.2 standard for future connectivity. There's also an optical input for a second source such as your games console.

A serious improvement for your TV's sound and part of an exceptional wireless music system - the Panasonic SC-ALL70TEB is the total entertainment system."
