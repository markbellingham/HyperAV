This low-profile 2.1 Channel Sound bar includes a stand-alone Subwoofer to deliver a strong 120W power output. At 750mm wide the HTB18 compliments small to medium-sized flat panel TVs, boosting TV sound as well as offering Bluetooth Wireless Music Playback from a Smartphone, Tablet or Laptop computer.
Sleek and stylish 2.1ch Sound bar

Add bass and presence to your TV sound listening with the HTB18's integrated main L/R channel speakers combined with a separate subwoofer to deliver a rich and detailed 2.1 channel sound.

Wireless Music Streaming with Bluetooth

Use your Sound bar as a high quality speaker to stream music wirelessly from a Bluetooth equipped device (Laptop/Smartphone etc. ) and enjoy great sound played back through the powerful speakers.

Space Saving Delta-form Design

The slim Delta-form design provides a stylish appearance to match and enhance most room interiors. The top panel of the unit is inclined to provide extra space inside and accommodate the large speaker units while at the same time maintaining a low-profile (65.5mm) so as not to obstruct your TV viewing.

Free-standing or Wall Mountable

The multi-angle sound design makes it ideal for wall mounting below a flat panel TV - saving valuable counter space, but if wall mounting is not practical, this sound bar is equally at home on a shelf or TV cabinet."
