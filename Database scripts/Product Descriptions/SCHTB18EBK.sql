<p><b>Wireless Music Streaming with Bluetooth</b></p>
<p>Use your Sound bar as a high quality speaker to stream music wirelessly from a Bluetooth equipped device (Laptop/Smartphone etc. ) and enjoy great sound played back through the powerful speakers.</p>

<p><b>Space Saving Delta-form Design</b></p>
<p>The slim Delta-form design provides a stylish appearance to match and enhance most room interiors. The top panel of the unit is inclined to provide extra space inside and accommodate the large speaker units while at the same time maintaining a low-profile (65.5mm) so as not to obstruct your TV viewing.</p>

<p><b>Free-standing or Wall Mountable</b></p>
<p>The multi-angle sound design makes it ideal for wall mounting below a flat panel TV - saving valuable counter space, but if wall mounting is not practical, this sound bar is equally at home on a shelf or TV cabinet.</p>"
