SET prDescr_Long = "Take home cinema to the next level, with the Dolby Atmos optimised Onkyo SKSHT588 speaker package.

Engineered for Dolby Atmos sound
With this speaker package optimised for Dolby Atmos, you can be amongst the first in the world to experience the wonder of Dolby Atmos in your own home. Producing a multi-dimensional and totally immersive sound, Dolby Atmos has been hailed as the greatest advance in surround sound for 20 years - so don't miss out! The package is also compatible with the new DTS:X version of multi-dimensional sound.

Unique Atmos front speakers
The really special thing about this speaker pack are the front speakers. Combining both front and height channels, the speakers give a sense of height and dimension to the sound that makes Atmos so immersive. Far more convenient than having to cut holes for ceiling speakers, this Atmos speaker package offers the benefits of Atmos without the inconvenience.

Sound matched auxcillary speakers
Making sure the quality of sound remains high throughout the range, the centre and rear speakers are acoustically matched to the fronts. The crucial centre speaker is a two-way, bass reflex design that offers crisp, detailed sound that's essential for clear dialogue.

Atmos the easy way
As well as not having to fit ceiling speakers in your home, the main speakers can all be wall-mounted. This gives an ideal balance between keeping the speakers out of the way but without going to the expense and inconvenience of in-wall speaker systems.

Powerful bass from active subwoofer
It's not just a wrap-around sound that gives this system the feeling of being at the cinema but it's the powerful bass, too. The active subwoofer can be hidden out of sight, but with a 10-inch cone and dedicated 80w amplifier is anything but discreet when it comes to sound - powerful sound tracks will have you pinned to your seat!

The next step in home cinema but without the cost and installation requirements of other systems - the Onkyo SKSHT588 makes Atmos a whole lot more tempting."
