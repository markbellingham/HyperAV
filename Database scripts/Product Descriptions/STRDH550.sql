SET prDescr_Long = "With its broad range of features and excellent sound quality, the Sony STRDH550 offers the perfect introduction to AV.

Power to impress
Although the STR-DH550 is Sony's lead-in model, it still packs a powerful punch. With 140W per channel (at 6 ohms) the STR-DH550 has the punch lacking from many similarly priced one-box AV solutions. This means that, even in larger rooms, there's enough grunt to power along the most explosive of sound tracks. Compared to your TV speakers, you'll find a massively more spacious sound with previously unheard detail and far deeper bass.

Dolby and DTS Digital plus HD cinema sound
As you'd expect from Sony, cinematic sound quality is a top priority with the STR-DH550. In addition to Dolby and DTS digital decoding the Sony benefits from unique HD Digital Cinema Sound. Tuned to replicate the acoustics of famous Hollywood studios, the STRDH550 wraps sound around you like few others.

4K HDMI and USB
Four HDMI inputs handle even serious home cinema set-ups and they're also compatible with 4K signal pass through. In addition to this they're also compatible with 3D and ARC (Audio Return Channel) for much reduced cabling. At the front there's a USB socket for connecting your iPod, iPhone or memory stick and playing stored music. For older sources, there are composite, optical, coaxial and RCA phono connections.

Easy set up
Although technically advanced, setting up is fast and simple. BRAVIA SYNC links to other Sony BRAVIA products via HDMI, while Digital Cinema Auto Calibration (DCAC) optimises the settings to your room's requirements at the touch of a button. Other notable features include an RDS tuner radio, Portable Audio Enhancer and Night Mode listening. The clean, simple control layout and clear display also make this a user-friendly AV receiver.

Experience the difference a separate AV receiver can make, with the impressive STRDH550."
