SET prDescr_Long = "Following on from a long line of award-winners, the Sony STRDN1060 just keeps getting better.

Power aplenty
With an effortless 165 watts per channel (at 6 ohms) from its over-sized power transformer, there are very few speakers or rooms that faze the powerful Sony. The Sony STRDN1060 also uses a rigid, vibration resistant casing for the lowest sound distortion possible. It also uses specially selected components for class-leading sound quality.

Flexible outputs including multi-zone
With a second HDMI output you can enjoy audio and video in another room. You also get both active and passive audio outputs for complete zone 2 flexibility in a second room. The Sony is also able to be used in bi-amp mode. With the channels switched to 5.1, bi-amping gives separate amplification to your front speakers' bass and treble units (bi-wirable front speakers required). The end result gives added control and a wider, more dynamic sound.

High-Resolution audio compatible
As well as offering room-shaking power, the Sony STRDN1060 is also compatible with High-Resolution Audio. This offers a sound that's far more natural sounding than standard audio. The STR-DN1060 supports DSD 5.6MHz (2ch) decoding via USB and network connections, as well as DSD 2.8MHz (up to 5ch) decoding via HDMI, USB and network.

Transform the sound of your compressed music files
With Digital Sound Enhancement Engine HX (DSEE HX) you can transform the sound of your digital music files. Working with MP3, ACC, ATRAC and WMA files, DSEE HX restores the sound lost in the compression process and produces a richer, more natural sound that's closer to the original.

4K upscaling and HDCP2.2
A native 4K source can be passed directly through to 4K HDMI IN with the now standard HDCP2.2. Standard HD resolution can be enjoyed with higher quality and more visible detail thanks to video upscale technology. Previously, only upscaling from 1080/24p up to 4K/30p was possible, however for the new STR-DN1060 there's no limitation for the input video resolution.

Wi-Fi, Bluetooth with NFC and Apple AirPlay making streaming a breeze
With Ethernet and Wi-Fi built-in along with support for Apple's popular AirPlay and NFC Bluetooth the Sony covers all networking bases. NFC via Bluetooth lets you effortlessly sync compatible portable devices with a simple swipe of the unit next to the special remote. With AirPlay you can stream music from your iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch or iTunes along with compatible music apps like Spotify, straight to the receiver.

Spotify Connect and Google Cast
Spotify Connect lets you keep listening to your music, seamlessly, from your smartphone to home system when you arrive back. Google Cast lets you stream music from your Android phone effortlessly to the Sony, for simple, wireless sound.

Bring your music together with Sony SongPal
Download SongPal for your smartphone or tablet and take control of your music collection. Simply connect over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and you'll have seamless access to all your favourite tracks, whether they're stored on your PC, server, or online music service. The app can also be used to customise sound settings to ensure great, balanced audio, and control multi-room listening.

Just as brilliant with audio as it is with video, the Sony STRDN1060 continues to lead the pack."
