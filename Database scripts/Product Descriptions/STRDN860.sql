SET prDescr_Long = "<p>'Sony has once again produced a stellar budget amp that offers a huge performance at an excellent price.' 'What Hi-Fi? Sound & Vision magazine'. Group test winner. 5-star review. Tested at Â£400</p>

<p><b>Powerful, enveloping sound</b></p>
<p>When it comes to power, the latest STR-DN860 is as impressive as ever. The Sony is capable of outputting 150W per channel at 6 ohms (95W at 8 ohms), allowing great flexibility in your choice of speakers and room size. The Sony STRDN860 uses a rigid, vibration resistant casing for the lowest sound distortion possible. It also uses specially selected components for class-leading sound quality.</p>

<p><b>Bi-amp for superior sound</b></p>
<p>This 7.2 Sony receiver is also able to be used in bi-amp mode. With the channels switched to 5.1, bi-amping gives separate amplification to your front speakers' bass and treble units (bi-wirable front speakers required). The end result gives added control and a wider, more dynamic sound - both in stereo and surround modes.</p>

<p><b>High-Resolution audio compatible</b></p>
<p>As well as offering room-shaking power, the Sony STRDN860 is also compatible with High-Resolution Audio. This offers a sound that's far more natural sounding than standard audio. The STR-DN860 supports DSD 5.6MHz (2ch) decoding via USB and network connections, as well as DSD 2.8MHz (up to 5ch) decoding via HDMI, USB and network.</p>

<p><b>Hollywood inspired Digital Cinema Sound</b></p>
<p>The STRDN860 is also capable of some very clever sound processing. HD Digital Cinema Sound is a Sony developed technology designed to recreate the acoustics heard in Hollywood sound theatres. Utilising this mode with the front height channels gives a greater depth and accuracy to the sound. Imagine as a helicopter comes from above and lands, you'll hear the change in height as the movie unfolds on-screen.</p>

<p><b>4K upscaling and HDCP2.2</b></p>
<p>A native 4K source can be passed directly through to 4K HDMI IN with the now standard HDCP2.2. Standard HD resolution can be enjoyed with higher quality and more visible detail thanks to video upscale technology. Previously, only upscaling from 1080/24p up to 4K/30p was possible, however for the new STR-DN860 there's no limitation for the input video resolution.</p>

<p><b>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth with NFC and Apple AirPlay making streaming a breeze</b></p>
<p>With Ethernet and Wi-Fi built-in along with support for Apple's popular AirPlay and NFC Bluetooth the Sony covers all networking bases. NFC via Bluetooth lets you effortlessly sync compatible portable devices with a simple swipe of the unit next to the special remote. With AirPlay you can stream music from your iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch or iTunes along with compatible music apps like Spotify, straight to the receiver.</p>

<p><b>Spotify Connect and Google Cast</b></p>
<p>Spotify Connect lets you keep listening to your music, seamlessly, from your smartphone to home system when you arrive back. Google Cast lets you stream music from your Android phone effortlessly to the Sony, for simple, wireless sound.</p>

<p><b>Bring your music together with Sony SongPal</b></p>
<p>Download SongPal for your smartphone or tablet and take control of your music collection. Simply connect over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and you'll have seamless access to all your favourite tracks, whether they're stored on your PC, server, or online music service. The app can also be used to customise sound settings to ensure great, balanced audio, and control multi-room listening.</p>

<p>A fabulous all-rounder in so many respects, you simply can't go wrong with the Sony STRDN860.</p>"
