SET prDescr_Long = "Televisions continue to get thinner and as a result, so does the sound emitted by their skinny (and tinny) speaker systems. Roth AV introduces the Sub Zero soundbar to fix this problem without you having to break the bank.
TV Soundbar

The Roth Sub Zero has been designed to give you the high definition audio you need to accompany your HD picture. Using analogue and optical inputs, the Sub Zero will connect easily to any TV or audio sources – up to three at any one time.

With no need for a separate subwoofer the clever Sub Zero has two built-in Ultra-Bass drivers, allowing full range audio in a single discrete unit. Designed to perform in any room large or small, the Sub Zero will bring new life to your TV and you’ll hear detailed audio like never before. Using patented Fractal Expansion (FX) sound processing, you’ll also get a tremendous home cinema experience.

The Sub Zero can be wall or table mounted and at just 89mm deep, will complement any room. Set up is also simple so there will be no delays in enjoying your favorite movies or music. Designed for use with Flat Screen TV’s from 32' upward the Sub Zero will not be overwhelmed by the screen it is paired with - the Sub Zero will take on all comers and not be beaten for simple and effective sound enhancement. Put yourself in the movie, immerse yourself in the game or simply sit back and relax to your favorite music.

Simple, yet effective, touches finish off the Sub Zero: the bundled Roth remote enables sound adjustments directly from your listening position; the Sub Zero’s LED display is dimmable; table stands and wall brackets are included."
