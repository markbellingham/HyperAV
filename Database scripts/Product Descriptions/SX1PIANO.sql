SET prDescr_Long = "<p>Beautiful to look at and a delight to listen to, the talented Mission SX1 speakers are amongst the best in their class.</p>

<p><b>Cutting-edge drive unit technology</b></p>
<p>Starting at the top, the Mission SX1 deploys titanium domed tweeters for breathtaking results. The light yet rigid titanium gives astonishing purity and detail yet can reach frequencies of up to 40,000Hz! We may not be able to hear these frequencies, but expanding the range reduces harmonic distortion for a pure and natural sound.</p>

<p>Matching these are similarly impressive woofer units. The composite aluminium cones are tonally matched to the treble unit for smooth and consistent sound. The vented chassis allows for a fast, punchy bass that has the typical up-tempo sound you'd expect from Mission speakers.</p>

<p><b>Sweeping cabinet design for good looks and even better sound</b></p>
<p>Containing the high tech drive units is a cabinet design that's just as special. The sweeping curves of the cabinet design don't just look good, they also reduce standing waves for a less distorted sound quality. The cabinet is constructed from interleaving wood layers that are glued and pressed at high temperature for 48 hours and then left to cool naturally. The result of this time intensive construction is an acoustically inert design that lets you hear more of the music and less of the cabinet.</p>

<p><b>Stunning Piano Black finish</b></p>
<p>Rather than the black ash wood style used by the standard Mission SX1 speakers these speakers come finished in a rather special piano black. As the name suggests, the effect is built up of many layers and polished to a lustrous gloss finish, just as with the finest pianos.</p>

<p><b>Perfect phase crossover design for easy positioning</b></p>
<p>Mission realise that it's not always possible to arrange your living space around the speakers, which is why the SX1s are unfussy about placement. Designed for use in a number of different locations, including close to a rear wall, the SX1s aren't nearly as fussy as most speakers are with regards to room placement. Helping to ensure everyone hears a broad and detailed soundstage, the integrated treble waveguide disperses the delicate high frequencies across a broad space.</p>

<p>With a sound that's both powerful yet pure together with easy room placement, the Mission SX1 speakers stand ahead of the competition.</p>"
