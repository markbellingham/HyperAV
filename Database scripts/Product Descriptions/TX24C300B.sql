SET prDescr_Long = "<p>Compact good looks and a fine picture make the Panasonic Viera TX24C300B the perfect portable TV.</p>

<p><b>HD ready with up to 200Hz RMR for clear motion</b></p>
<p>With its 200Hz (RMR) motion processing, the Panasonic TX24C300B looks great with fast-moving action or sports. Thanks to the smooth and steady motion, it's much easier to keep your eye on the ball.</p>

<p><b>High contrast screen</b></p>
<p>Deeper blacks and brighter whites are the main benefit with this high contrast screen. Panasonic's experience also gives vivid colour, making this TV among the most life-like in its class.</p>

<p><b>USB interface with Media Player</b></p>
<p>With Panasonic's Media Player you can hook up your USB memory stick and playback a wide range of photo, music and video files. A wealth of customisation functions lets you add your own background music and effects, for a totally bespoke experience.</p>

<p><b>Twin HDMI connections</b></p>
<p>With not one but two HDMI sockets, you can connect up both a Blu-ray player and your choice of HD TV box - such as Sky, Virgin, Humax or BT. A digital output is ideal for a superior sounding sound base while the headphone socket lets you listen in private. Throw in a SCART socket and even your older sources can be accommodated.</p>

<p><b>Classic Panasonic style</b></p>
<p>With clean, simple lines and a timeless black finish, the Panasonic TX-24C300B is a classic design. Both the slim bezel and narrow depth make this a very unobtrusive and compact design that's ideal as a second or third TV.</p>

<p>Bring quality viewing to your bedroom, kitchen or sturdy, with the top-performing Panasonic TX24C300B.</p>"
