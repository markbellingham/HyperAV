SET prDescr_Long = "Play Dawn of the Planet of the Apes on Blu-ray and we're faced with one of the crispest Blu-ray pictures we've seen on a 4K TV.' 'What Hi-Fi? Sound & Vision magazine'. 5-star review. Tested at Â£1800.

4K Ultra HD
With UHD (Ultra High Definition) 4K screen resolution, the Panasonic TX-50CX802B brings astonishing levels of detail to your home viewing. This resolution is four times greater than the more conventional 1920 x 1080 Full HD TVs and it's a difference you can clearly see.

4K Studio Master Processor
Panasonic's new 4K Studio Master Processor contains unrivalled processing ability from the past masters of reference-quality plasma and professional monitors. Together with Wide Colour Phosphor technology, it ensures accurate colour, deep blacks and brilliant brightness for a true-to life picture.

Local Dimming Pro
Local Dimming Pro enhances contrast levels, giving extraordinarily life-like realism. It does this by providing individual control over a large array of LEDs backlights. What's more, dozens of picture 'zones' are analysed and adjusted separately to boost shadow detail.

New Freeview Play for easy access to catch up TV
This TV is among the first TVs to have Freeview Play. This combines catch-up TV, on-demand services and live television to make watching what you want, when you want, simple. It's free and compatible with broadband services, while BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, All 4 and Demand 5 don't need specific applications, making scroll-back TV easy (requires broadband Internet connection with a minimum speed of 2Mbps).

My home screen 2.0 powered by Firefox OS and quad-core processor
Another great feature with the TX50CX802B is a powerful new operating system, powered by Firefox. My Home Screen 2.0 powered by Firefox OS offers a single 'gateway' to all TV channels, apps and connected devices. This makes navigating the vast array of content far easier than with other smart TVs and, thanks to the powerful new Quad-Core Pro processor, it's fast too.

Effortless operation with my Stream2 and Voice Assistant Pro
My Stream 2 learns the type of programmes and content you enjoy, from multiple sources, and then makes personalised recommendations, just for you! Voice Assistant means you simply have to speak into the controller to bring up content and search results.

The smart choice
When it comes to smart TV functionality, the TX50CX802B has plenty to offer. A broad range of web apps are complemented by a full web browser, and DLNA-certified streaming makes it easy to transfer music and video files from your laptop or NAS drive to the TV. Also standard is Swipe and Share, which lets you use the Panasonic VIERA 2 app on your smartphone, making it easy to stream pictures, videos and music straight to the TV - no cables required.

If you're looking for a TV that pushes the boundaries beyond normal expectations, the Panasonic TX50CX802B is it!"
