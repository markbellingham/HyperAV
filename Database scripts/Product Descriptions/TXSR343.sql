SET prDescr_Long = "<p>The Onkyo TXSR343 makes getting into the joys of home cinema easy; and once you've heard the difference you won't want to be without it!</p>

<p><b>Transform the sound of your home entertainment</b></p>
<p>Using Onkyo's WRAT (Wide Range Amplifier Technology), the TXSR343 delivers knock-out sound with your movies, gaming and music. For signal purity, Onkyo use a discrete amplifier circuit rather than an inferior IC chip. Other signs of top quality electronics include the Burr Brown DAC (Digital to Analogue Convertor). Taken together, it's little wonder the TXSR343 is one of the best-sounding AV receivers in its class.</p>

<p><b>The latest connections</b></p>
<p>This might be Onkyo's most basic AVR but that doesn't stop it having the latest connectivity. The TXSR343 features the latest HDMI 2.0a connections and supports HDCP 2.2, which means you can stream UltraHD video and that it's ready for the next generation of 4K discs.</p>

<p><b>Stream music from your mobile with Bluetooth</b></p>
<p>With a Bluetooth receiver built in, it's easy to enjoy your music from other devices. Pair with your smartphone, tablet, laptop or PC and wirelessly stream all your favourite music. With the possibility of streaming music services, such as Spotify, Deezer and Tidal, as well as your own music library, you get access to near unlimited music! Advanced Music Optimiser improves the dynamic response from compressed music sources, adding 'sparkle' to the sound and restoring the sound quality.</p>

<p><b>Ready for your streaming media player</b></p>
<p>Not only does the Onkyo TXSR343 feature an HDMI input for your choice of media player, it also has a dedicated USB power supply for it. Keep up with your video subscription services and other programs streamed from the Internet with ease.</p>

<p><b>Getting started made easy</b></p>
<p>Connecting up an AV receiver for the first time can be a daunting experience: but not with the Onkyo! Take a look at the back panel and you'll see all the inputs clearly and individually labelled, making set-up a logical process. Once wired up, an overlaid, on-screen display set-up via HDMI makes getting started easy.</p>

<p>As the perfect introduction to home cinema, it doesn't get any more rewarding than the Onkyo TXSR343.</p>"
