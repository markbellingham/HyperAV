SET prDescr_Long = "Combining all the features you need plus Pioneer's legendary quality, the VSX329 is a great way to get into surround sound.

Quality sound at a bargain price
With 100W per channel (at 6 ohm load) the VSX329K has the power for all but the largest rooms. Using a Texas Instruments Aureus Digital Signal Processor, the VSX-329 includes both Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD high resolution audio decoders. It also has Pioneer's Front Stage Surround Advance system - simply place all the speakers by the TV and let the VSX-329 take care of the phasing. Working much like a quality soundbar, it's perfect for when you can't run speakers to the rear of the room.

USB and multiple sockets
Also standard is a front-mounted USB socket. Compatible with all the Apple iPhones from 3G to 5S and most iPods, it lets you play stored music and stream music stations like Spotify via the internet connection on your phone. There's also both optical and coaxial digital inputs, a range of audio and composite video connections and a headphone socket with its own 'phones surround sound', designed to give a cinema effect.

Designed to make the most of your speakers
Quite often, different types of speakers are used in a surround sound set-up, all with slightly differing phases. This causes a slightly incoherent sound, so Phase control corrects the various phase delays for a more articulate and precise sound. Sound Delay (LipSync) ensures the vocals you hear match the lip movements you see onscreen.

As an ideal way of getting into the joys of surround sound, the Pioneer VSX329 offers the perfect introduction."
