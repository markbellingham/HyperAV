SET prDescr_Long = "This two-component system composed of a soundbar and subwoofer produces 160W of total power. Clear, realistic, all-enveloping surround sound from the soundbar and deep bass from the subwoofer that has been tuned to match the soundbar ensure high audio performance from TV and BDs.

Soundbar Produces Expansive and Clear Surround Sound

The soundbar houses a digital amp and two 5.5cm cone speakers with large magnets to ensure high sound clarity. Its superb structural design allows high capacity cabinet volume for very powerful and clear sound, even though the body is very slim.

Wireless Active Subwoofer with Advanced YST II Reproduces Deep Bass with Clarity and Power

This 16cm subwoofer features a large magnet and a front-firing configuration. Its high sound quality design takes advantage of Yamaha’s proprietary Advanced YST II and a Linear Port to produce deep and smooth bass. The circuit board has an ideal grounding pattern that ensures stable current supply for prodigious bass output. This subwoofer is capable of delivering powerful movie effect sounds and rich, deep bass.

AIR SURROUND XTREME Provides Powerful Surround Sound

Yamaha’s exclusive AIR SURROUND XTREME reproduces 7.1-channel surround sound with high quality, excellent imaging and rich presence, far superior to that of any other soundbar. You’ll experience an extremely realistic and impressive sound field, with clear dialogue in the front and dynamic sound action at the back.

Compatible with Various Surround Sound Formats

The YAS-201 is compatible with popular surround sound formats, such as Dolby Digital and DTS Digital Surround, so you get the full effect of multichannel movie sound.
Clear Voice Makes Dialogue and Narrations Easy to Hear

Clear Voice raises the level of dialogue and narrations while maintaining overall sound quality. Movies and TV shows, sports commentary and news broadcasts are more clearly audible.
UniVolume Maintains the Same Volume Level

This welcome feature, made possible by Yamaha-developed technology, maintains a consistent volume level between different channels, programmes, commercials and input sources. It can be switched on and off.

Low Style Design Further Reduces Height, for Convenient Positioning in Front of a TV Set

With a height of only 9.8 cm, the soundbar can be easily positioned in front of a TV so it straddles the TV stand. With the stand removed, the height can be adjusted.

Can Also Be Hung on a Wall

If the TV is hanging on a wall, you can remove the stand and hang the soundbar on the wall as well.
Wireless Active Subwoofer Allows Flexible Placement

The Wireless Subwoofer does not have to be connected to the Soundbar, so setup and placement are faster and easier. This is a convenient subwoofer that delivers powerful, high quality bass sound.
Wireless Streaming from iPod/iPhone/iPad and Mac/PC

The optional YIT-W12 Wireless Transmitter lets you enjoy music wirelessly from your iPod/iPhone/iPad or Mac/PC. Yamaha-developed AirWired technology provides uncompressed linear PCM transmission for clear, accurate sound output.

TV Remote Repeater for Signal Transmission

Even if the YAS-201 blocks the TV’s remote control signal, the TV Remote Repeater on the back transmits the signal to the TV so operation is not affected.
Learning Function Allows Operation with the TV Remote Control

The YAS-201 can 'learn' the TV remote control operation, so you can use the TV remote control to easily turn the YAS-201 on and off and to adjust its volume.
Simple to Operate Remote Control Supplied

The YAS-201 remote is simple and easy to use. It lets you turn the power on and off, adjust the volume and do other basic operations, and even lets you switch the surround modes. Together with the Learning function, you can use either the TV remote or the Yamaha remote for easy operation.
Stylish Design Achieves Both Visual Beauty and Ease of Use

Low enough to be placed neatly in front of a TV, the body has an elegantly curved front surface. Its glossy black finish matches flat-screen TVs and will add a stylish accent to your entertainment area. Glossy white finish is also available to match white TVs."
