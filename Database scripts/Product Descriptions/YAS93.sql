SET prDescr_Long = "Offering a substantial upgrade in sound plus class-leading convenience, the Yamaha YAS93 makes better sound from your TV easier than ever.

Spacious surround sound effects
Consisting of a slim sound bar with integral subwoofer, the YAS93 contains everything you need for effective sound enhancement within just one unit. At the heart of this stylish soundbar is AIR SURROUND XTREME. Using 24kHz HRTF (Head Related Transfer Function) technology it clearly separates the sounds in front of you from those that come from the sides or rear. The effect gives 7.1-channel surround sound, without the need for extra speakers!

Powerful bass response
In addition to offering a more spacious sound, the YAS93 has excellent bass depth, too. With dual-driver subwoofers built-in and a bass reflex cabinet, the Yamaha YAS93 provides a solid bass response that's a league above just about any TV speaker system.

Clearer dialogue
With some soundtracks, especially where there's a lot happening, it can be hard to hear what's being said. Thanks to the Yamaha's Clear Voice it's now easy to follow dialogue, exactly as it's spoken, while UniVolume keeps programmes and commercials at the same volume level - making watching commercial TV a great deal less irritating!

TV remote repeater
Additional features with the YAS93 include a TV remote repeater and learning function. With the TV remote repeater, the soundbar can be placed in front of the TV's IR receiver, without loss of remote functionality. The YAS-93 will also 'learn' the TV remote operation, allowing it to switch the soundbar on/off and adjust the volume - effectively meaning you can just stick with the TV's remote for most of the time.

Upgrade your TV's sound, without losing the ease of use, with the impressive Yamaha YAS93."
